LaIngaugeProf is a personal project I am making to get back into programming and create a website leveraging LLMS to aid in language learning by conversation and active use of a language.

The goal of the website is to have a pay as you use model that trumps other websites hefty subscription fees, with a website that is as cheap as possible to use for students who need to save their money.

The personal goal of mine with writing this is to create something that I use routinely and genuinely enjoy the experience of when learning a new language, as well as learning how to create a scalable, yet affordable backend with this website.
